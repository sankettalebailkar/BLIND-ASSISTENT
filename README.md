# BLIND-ASSISTENT
Blind Person Assistant is a real-time, Raspberry-Pi–based vision system designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely. It uses a camera, AI object detection (YOLOv8), edge-based obstacle detection, and offline voice feedback to announce hazards like people, vehicles, poles, stairs, potholes, and walls — all without any display.
