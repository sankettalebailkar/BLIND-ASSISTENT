# Blind Person Assistant

The Blind Person Assistant is a real-time, low-cost assistive vision system designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely. It runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 using the Pi Camera V2 and performs object detection, edge-based obstacle detection, distance estimation, and offline voice feedback.

## Features
- Real-time YOLOv8 object detection
- Detects people, vehicles, poles, stairs, potholes, animals, etc.
- Edge-detection fallback for unrecognized obstacles (walls)
- Offline text-to-speech (no internet required)
- Distance estimation based on bounding box size
- Debounce logic to avoid repeated announcements
- Works headless (no screen)
- Optimized for Raspberry Pi 5 + Pi Camera V2

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- OpenCV  
- Pyttsx3 (Offline TTS)  
- Raspberry Pi 5  
- Pi Camera V2  

## How It Works
1. The camera captures frames.  
2. YOLOv8 detects objects in real-time.  
3. Distance estimator calculates how far each object is.  
4. If no objects are detected, edge detection checks for walls/stairs.  
5. The system announces only important hazards through offline TTS.
